# react-native-hateos-explorer

This project was the outcome of messing about with react native and a HATEOAS API at the React Amsterdam 2017 workshop. The idea was to display the data returned by an API, and then convert the Links provided into touchable elements to traverse the API.

I initially had some real data loading set up with various security hacks to access my employers internal API, but have replaced that with a constant for now (testData). Will put it back in if I ever find a suitable public HATEOS API that doesn't require much fuss.
